## Real-time Object Detection App with Tensorflow.JS and React.JS 

## Features
- Install Node.js to use Tensorflow.JS and React.JS  
- Import COCO SSD (Common Objects in Context — Single Shot Multibox Detector) model to use  
-> A pre-trained object that identifies and localizes objects in images detection model  
-> It’s based on the SSD architecture, which is designed for real-time object detection    
-> The model is trained on the COCO dataset, a large-scale dataset containing images of everyday scenes with common objects in their natural context  
  
- Build a React.JS app that accesses your webcam 4
- Make detections from your webcam in real time
- Customise detection styling
