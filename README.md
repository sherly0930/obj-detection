## Real-time Object Detection Web Application with Tensorflow.JS and React.JS 

This is a self-learning hands-on project based on a tutorial. The real-time object detection application uses TensorFlow.js and React.js to detect and localize objects from a live webcam.

## Features
- Install Node.js to use Tensorflow.JS and React.JS  
- Import COCO SSD (Common Objects in Context — Single Shot Multibox Detector) model to use  
-> A pre-trained object that identifies and localizes objects in images detection model  
-> It’s based on the SSD architecture, which is designed for real-time object detection    
-> The model is trained on the COCO dataset, a large-scale dataset containing images of everyday scenes with common objects in their natural context  
  
- Build a React.JS app that accesses your webcam 4
- Make detections from your webcam in real time
- Customise detection styling

## Running App Instruction
Type: "npm start" to run the app
